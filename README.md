# CS-210 Programming Languages

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

Developed an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer, analyzing daily text records of purchased items to optimize the layout of their produce section based on purchase frequency.

## What did you do particularly well?

I incorporated all of their requested functionality using professional, well-documented, and readable code, while also using input validation and error handling to anticipate, detect, and respond to runtime and user errors.

## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Using maps was acceptable for this program, but with a larger list it might experience high memory consumption. Therefore, I would consider alternative methods to optimize the program more effectively.

Additionally, I would consider improving the user experience by displaying a list of items and enabling users to select an item from the list, rather than requiring manual entry.

## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Working with file input and output can be challenging, but I've managed to overcome any issues thanks to resources such as Stack Overflow and official documentation. I intend to continue utilizing similar resources throughout my career.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

This project provided me with the opportunity to successfully convert functional requirements into a functional C++ program while adhering to industry-standard best practices.

## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by utilizing in-line comments, applying appropriate naming conventions, and modularizing the code into well-defined functions within the GroceryTracker class.
